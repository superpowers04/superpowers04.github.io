		<h1>Basic biography<br/></h1>
		I am currently a Minecraft Community Support and Prism Launcher Discord Helper that is probably inactive a lot more than I should be<br/>

		<!--<b>
			Due to events being caused by a comic causing me to question a lot about myself, anything beyond this point might not be accurate at the moment, If you're curious about something, please directly ask me about it.
		</b>  <sub>The comic is <a href="https://rain.thecomicseries.com/comics/1/">Rain</a>. It's a good comic you should read. You might want to read it across multiple days, not all in one 17-20 hour sitting like I did, else it'll hit you like a ton of bricks<sub> --><br/>

				</li><li>If you have a question or need help with something, Please send me the question instead of saying that you need help or pinging me
					<ul><li>It makes response times from me faster because I can immediately respond to you instead of having to respond and then wait for you to type out your message <sub>then it's a question about if you can get your Minecraft Java Account back because it got hacked and I have to inform you that I do not work for Mojank and then you get mad at me because you had to wait 5 hours for a response because I was ASLEEP a-</sub> wait, what was I talking about again? oh right</li></ul>				</li><li><h3>I don't work for Mojang</h3>
					<ul><li> None of the helpers or admins in Minecraft Community Support are affiliated with Mojang or Microsoft. We cannot help with account issues or recover your account.

As of writing this, I've been working on this piece of shit for like 3 years(Started late 2021, before Psych Engine even existed !!!!</td>
